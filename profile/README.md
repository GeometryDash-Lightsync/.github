# Geometry Dash Lightsync

## About ❔

Geometry Dash Lightsync is a Fangame and GDPS (Geometry Dash Private Server) created by [Izumi (Chumiu)](https://github.com/Chumiu) with a design based on the launcher [Nexkit](https://github.com/Al3sKa/NexKit) created by [Al3sKa](https://github.com/Al3sKa)

Our purpose is creating an unique version of Geometry Dash, adding new features and also, its own version of the story of the game (lore)

## Notable features 💫

* A new design for the game UI
* Fanmade content such as new main levels (and more coming soon)
* Custom servers
* More icons and achievements to the game and different ways for unlocking them (and more coming soon)
* Options for customizing the main menu and the player
* Geode support (Only with a custom [whitelist](https://github.com/GeometryDash-Lightsync/Geode-mods-whitelist))

## Download 📥

* [Windows]() 🖥️
* [Android]() 📱

## How to Install ⚒️

**You DO NOT have to uninstall Geode or your Geometry Dash application, Lightsync has its own separated app for both softwares, so all your stuff will not get replaced/modified/removed**

## Launcher Installation

As same as the Core, just install it as a normal APK. After installing it, just open it.

## Important

Open the game after installation, you need to download Geode assets for installing the rest of Lightsync's stuff, you may notice that loading layer is a bit strange

If you did everything good, the launcher will show this message: “Geode is not
installed” and will start downloading Geode assets. After the download, open the
game and wait to the in-game download finishes.

*Note: The game must crash after a small period of time when the download had
finished, that is normal, as you don’t have some assets that belong to the
dependencies.*

## Dependencies

After all the process, the game should made a couple of files on the Android folder.

You have to copy all the .geode files on the folder named “Dependencies”

And paste them to the next path:
* *your storage path*/Android/media/com.glsync.launcher/game/geode/mods

And then, open the game!
